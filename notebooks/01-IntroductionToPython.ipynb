    "# Introduction to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will give you an overview of the basic features of the Python programming language.  This introduction won't make you an ace programmer --- only practice will do that. However, it will give you an introduction to some of the most important features of the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why programming is hard to learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming a computer is a skill, just like playing a musical instrument or speaking a second language. And just like those skills, it takes a lot of work to get good at it --- the only way to acquire a skill is through practice.  There is nothing special or magical about people who are experts, other than the quality and quantity of their experience! However, not all practice is equally effective.  A large amount of psychological research has shown that practice needs to be *deliberate*, meaning that it focuses on developing the specific skills that one needs to perform the skill, at a level that is always pushing one's ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have never programmed before, then it's going to seem hard, just as it would seem hard for a native English speaker to start speaking Mandarin.  However, just as a beginning guitarist needs to learn to play their scales, we will teach you how to perform the basics of programming, which you can then use to do more powerful things.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important aspects of computer programming is that you can try things to your heart's content; the worst thing that can happen is that the program will crash.  Trying new things and making mistakes is one of the keys to learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "The hardest part of programming is figuring out why something didn't work, which we call *debugging*.  In programming, things are going to go wrong in ways that are often confusing and opaque. Every programmer has a story about spending hours trying to figure out why something didn't work, only to realize that the problem was completely obvious in hindsight.  The more practice you get, the better you will get at figuring out how to fix these errors.  But there are a few strategies that can be helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use the web\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, you should take advantage of the fact that there are millions of people programming in Python around the world, so nearly any error message you see has already been seen by someone else.  Whenever I experience an error that I don't understand, the first thing that I do is to copy and paste the error message into a search engine. Often this will provide several pages discussing the problem and the ways that people have solved it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rubber duck debugging\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind *rubber duck debugging* is to pretend that you are trying to explain what your code is doing to an inanimate object, like a rubber duck.  Often, the process of explaning it aloud is enough to help you find the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting access to Python\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to try out Python without having to install it on your own computer (or if you have a computer that doesn't support it, such as a Chromebook), the best way to try it out is using a web platform that supports *notebooks*, which are documents that allow you to combine text and code; this book was actually written using such notebooks.  Two good options are [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) and [Kaggle Kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/kernels).  **TBD: MAKE ALL CHAPTERS AVAILABLE ON BOTH**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do want to install it on your own computer, we recommend installing the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) software package, which will provide you with Python as well as many related packages. \n",

    "## Getting started with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "When we work with Python, we can do this at the command line in a terminal or (as we will do) using a *Jupyter notebook*.\n",
    "Notebooks are composed of *cells*, each of which can contain either Python code or text.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks use a special kind of text known as [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), which allows formatting (such as headings or text styles like bold and italics).  If you were to double-click on this cell in Jupyter, you would be able to edit the text. Once you are done editing, hit the **Run** button (the triangular arrow button above), or press Shift+Enter, and the text will be shown normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following cell is a **code** cell, which we use for Python code. Code cells are denoted in Jupyter by shading in gray.  In a code cell, we type Python commands. When we hit the **Run** button (the triangular arrow button above), or press Shift+Enter, our commands will run and a result will print out in an output cell. \n",
    "\n",
    "One difference between a code cell and a Markdown cell is that the code cell has a number to its left surrounded by square brackets. If you type a command into the cell and then run it, the result will appear below, with the same number to its left.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the simplest case, if we just type in a number, the cell will simply respond with that number. In the code cell below, we have typed the number 3. Click on the cell to edit or run the code again (Shift+Enter)."
